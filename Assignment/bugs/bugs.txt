1. BLOCK and END tokens not in the lexer.
2. /r not ignored by the lexer.
3. we cannot include checks for hello := hi + 5 in the lexer, where hi is not defined earlier
   as the lexer does not understand scoping, think about function declarations. Only the parser will
   be able to do this using the AST.
